Introduction
The introduction of the proposal discusses the growing importance of energy efficiency in industrial automation, particularly in robotic cells. Robotic cells are systems with multiple robots working together on various
tasks. As these systems become more prevalent, optimizing their energy consumption becomes a critical
concern. Energy-efficient operations not only reduce costs but also contribute to sustainability.
